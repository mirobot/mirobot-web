This project has always been about building an open source robot, but until now the physical hardware was not actually open source, only some of the arduino libraries I had written to drive it. I'm proud to announce a new GitHub repository ([https://github.com/bjpirt/mirobot-chassis](https://github.com/bjpirt/mirobot-chassis)) which contains the CAD files for making the chassis. You can take these and cut your own now should you feel that way inclined. The easiest way if you don't have your own laser cutter is probably to use [Razor Lab](http://www.razorlab.co.uk) - there's a file already laid out to send to them.

I'm waiting for what should be the final version of the PCB to make its way back to me from Ragworm and once I've checked it over I'll be open sourcing the PCB designs as well. You can see the current PCB in this photo that Ragworm tweeted:
