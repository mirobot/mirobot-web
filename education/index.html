		There are apps available covering most skill levels, from basic point-and-click apps for beginners to more involved drag-and-drop block-based apps. Here's a selection, but you can see them all at <a href="http://apps.mirobot.io">apps.mirobot.io</a>. All apps are completely free, cross platform and run in your web browser which means there's no software that needs installing before you can use Mirobot.
