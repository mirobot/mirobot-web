      <p>Because Mirobot is open hardware you're welcome to take the designs and get them made yourself. In fact this is encouraged, it's a great way of beginning to understand what's involved in making a physical product so you can go on and make your own.</p><p><a href="../fabricate/">Get started fabricating your own parts.</a></p>
