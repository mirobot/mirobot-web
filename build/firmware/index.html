      <p>Mirobot comes ready to roll, but if you want to change things here's how to customise the Arduino code that runs at the heart of every Mirobot.</p>

      <h3>Step one</h3>
      <p>Make sure you've got the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. If you haven't, <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/main/software">download it</a> and install it.</p>
      <hr class="clear" />

    <div class="inner">
      <img class="right" src="/assets/guide/firmware/02.png" />
      <h3>Step two</h3>
      <p>Install the libraries we need to be able to run the code. These can be downloaded from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bjpirt/mirobot-arduino/releases/download/v1.0/Mirobot.zip">The Mirobot Arduino library</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/bjpirt/HotStepper/releases/download/v1.0/HotStepper.zip">The HotStepper stepper motor library</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://arduiniana.org/PWMServo/PWMServo_v2.zip">The PWMServo servo library</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you have downloaded them, they need installing. Go to the menu <em>Sketch >> Import Library >> Add Library</em> and when prompted select the zip file you just downloaded</p>
      <p>You can tell that they are installed properly because when you go to <em>Sketch >> Import Library</em> again they will be listed</p>
      <p>If you are having problems installing them, <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries">see here for more details</a></p>
      <hr class="clear" />
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="pullout even">
    <div class="inner">
      <img class="left" src="/assets/guide/firmware/03.png" />
      <h3>Step three</h3>
      <p>In your <em>File >> Examples</em> menu, you should have a menu item for Mirobot (if you haven't, then the library is not installed properly). Select "socket_example" and it should open up a short sketch in the Arduino IDE.</p>
      <hr class="clear" />
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="pullout odd">
    <div class="inner">
      <img class="right" src="/assets/guide/firmware/04.png" />
      <h3>Step four</h3>
      <p>Plug Mirobot into your computer using the USB <-> Serial adapter. If you don't have one of these you can get one from: TODO</p>
      <p>Select the port from the <em>Tools >> Serial Port</em> menu</p>
      <p>Select "Arduino Duemilanove w/ ATmega328" from the <em>Tools >> Board</em> menu</p>
      <p>Click on the upload icon or choose <em>File >> Upload</em> from the menu. You should see a success message saying that the firmware has been successfully compiled and uploaded to Mirobot</p>
      <p>Now you can either use it as normal or start from here customising the firmware to do your bidding!</p>
